    "# Stop Trader\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of the `stop` trader is to explore whether it makes sense to set up stop-losses (or stop-buys) when entering a long position (or when selling everything).\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine that you buy a certain amount $a$ of a cryptocurrency (e.g. `BTC`) at price $p$. Is it a good idea to set up a stop-loss at some lower price $p' < p$? If so, how to determine the price $p'$? What if later the price $p$ goes up? Should we then adjust (increase) the stop-loss price $p'$ as well? These are some of the questions that we would like to answer by evaluating many instances of the `stop` trader over the `BTCUSD` price history.\n",
    "\n",
    "At any given moment the trader has (on its account) some amount $b$ of a base (crypto)currency (e.g. `BTC`) and some amount $q$ of a quote currency (e.g. `USD`). Let $p$ denote the base (crypto)currency price (e.g. `BTCUSD` price). If $b * p \\ge q$ we say that the trader is in the `LONG` state. Otherwise, we say that the trader is in the `CASH` state.\n",
    "\n",
    "* If the trader gets into the `LONG` state we define the stop-loss at the price $p' := (1 - \\alpha) * p < p$, where $\\alpha \\in (0; 1)$ is a trader hyper-parameter (called `stop_order_margin`). As long as the trader is in the `LONG` state we only allow the price of the stop-loss $p'$ to increase over time. When the price $p$ drops and hits the stop-loss the trader automatically switches to the `CASH` state (by selling all its $b$ base (crypto)currency at price $p'$).\n",
    "* Similarly, if the trader gets into the `CASH` state we define the stop-buy at the price $p' := (1 + \\alpha) * p > p$. As long as the trader is in the `CASH` state we only allow the price of the stop-buy $p'$ to decrease over time. When the price $p$ increases and hits the stop-buy the trader automatically switches to the `LONG` state (by buying as much as possible base (crypto)currency at price $p'$).\n",
    "\n",
    "One can easily observe that if there were no transaction fees and if we could always execute the stop-sells (stop-buys) at exactly the specified price $p'$, this strategy would never be worse than the Buy-And-HODL strategy. Moreover, we would (under these ideal circumstances) never loose any money (only potentially gain). Note: If you think that these assumptions (no transaction fees etc.) are far-fetched then take a look at the assumptions behind the famous [Black-Scholes model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black%E2%80%93Scholes_model) (they are even more unrealistic).\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, we do have non-negligible transaction fees and the stop orders are (usually) not executed at exactly the desired price $p'$, but at a worse price (especially if there is not enough liquidity). Therefore, we need to tune the hyper-parameters of the trader so that we do not incur too many transaction fees and still stay profitable.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the above-mentioned `stop_order_margin` $\\alpha$ we have the following hyper-parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `stop_order_move_margin` $\\beta$: (A) If the trader is in the `LONG` state and the stop-loss price: $p' \\le (1 - \\beta) * p$ we allow the stop-loss price to increase. (B) Similarly, if the trader is in the `CASH` state and the stop-buy price $p' \\ge (1 + \\beta) * p$ we allow the stop-buy price to decrease.\n",
    "* `stop_order_increase_per_day` $\\gamma_+$: In the case (A) we allow the stop-loss price to increase by at most $\\gamma_+ * 100\\%$ per day, although we do not allow the stop-loss price to exceed the $(1 - \\beta) * p$ threshold.\n",
    "* `stop_order_decrease_per_day` $\\gamma_-$: In the case (B) we allow the stop-buy price to decrease by at most $\\gamma_- * 100\\%$ per day, although we do not allow the stop-buy price to drop below the $(1 + \\beta) * p$ threshold.\n",
    "\n",
    "Batch evaluation of the `stop` trader reveals that setting $\\alpha = \\beta = 0.1$, $\\gamma_+ = 0.01$, and $\\gamma_- = 0.1$ gives a reasonable performance (although there are many other settings which perform similarly). With these specific parameters the trader performs as follows (evaluated over 6 month time periods within the 4 year time period: `[2017-01-01 - 2021-01-01)` with 5 minute sampling rate):\n",

Thus it is questionable whether an average person would be able to set the stop-losses / stop-buys better than this algorithm. If not then an average person would be better off with HODLing without any stop-losses."
