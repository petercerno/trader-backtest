// The trader is executed as follows:
// - At every step the trader receives the latest OHLC tick `T[i]`, current
//   account balances, and updates its internal state. The current time is at
//   the end of the OHLC tick `T[i]` time period. (The trader is not updated on
//   zero volume OHLC ticks. These OHLC ticks indicate a gap in a price history,
//   which could have been caused by an unresponsive exchange or its API.)
// - Then the trader needs to decide what orders to emit. There are no other
//   active orders on the exchange at this moment (see the explanation below).
// - Once the trader decides what orders to emit, the exchange will execute
//   (or cancel) all these orders on the follow-up OHLC tick T[i+1]. The trader
//   does not see the follow-up OHLC tick T[i+1], so there is no peeking into
//   the future.
// - Once all orders are executed (or canceled) by the exchange, the trader
//   receives the follow-up OHLC tick T[i+1] and the whole process repeats.
// Note that at every step every order gets either executed or canceled by the
// exchange. This is a design simplification so that there are no active orders
// that the trader needs to maintain over time.
// In practice, however, we would not cancel orders if they would be re-emitted
// again. We would simply modify the existing orders (from the previous
// iteration) based on the updated state.
// Also note that the OHLC history sampling rate defines the frequency at which
// the trader is updated and emits orders. Traders should be designed in
// a frequency-agnostic way. In other words, they should have similar behavior
// and performance regardless of how frequently they are called. Traders should
// not assume anything about how often and when exactly they are called. One
// reason for that is that the exchanges (or their APIs) sometimes become
// unresponsive for random periods of time (and we see that e.g. in the gaps
// in the price histories). Therefore, we encourage to test the traders on OHLC
// histories with various sampling rates and gaps.
